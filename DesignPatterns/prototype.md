#### Prototype Design Pattern

The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying existing objects. This is useful when the construction of an object is expensive or complex, and you want to avoid creating multiple instances of the same object by creating a copy instead

*Pros:*

- Avoids the overhead of creating new objects by copying existing objects instead.
- Allows you to create new objects without specifying the exact class to create.
- Gives you greater control over the creation of objects, as you can change the prototype and all subsequent copies will be updated.

*Cons:*

- Requires that the objects you want to copy have a deep copy implementation, which can be complex to implement.
- Can be confusing to use if you are not familiar with the pattern.

*When to use the prototype pattern:*

- When the process of creating new objects is expensive or complex, and you want to avoid this overhead.
- When you want to create new objects by copying existing objects, rather than specifying the exact class to create.
- When you want to have greater control over the creation of new objects, and be able to change the prototype and have all subsequent copies updated accordingly.

*Use Case:*

You are building an application that allows users to design and print custom business cards. The business cards can have different designs and text, and the user can choose from a variety of fonts and colors. When the user is happy with their design, they can click a "print" button to print the business card.

Instead of creating a new business card object every time the user makes a change to their design, you decide to use the prototype pattern to create a copy of the business card object instead. This way, you can avoid the overhead of creating a new object each time the user makes a change, and the user can quickly see their design updates in real-time.

*Implementation:*

```csharp
public abstract class BusinessCardPrototype
{
    public string Design { get; set; }
    public string Text { get; set; }
    public string Font { get; set; }
    public string Color { get; set; }

    public abstract BusinessCardPrototype Clone();
}

public class BusinessCard : BusinessCardPrototype
{
    public BusinessCard(string design, string text, string font, string color)
    {
        Design = design;
        Text = text;
        Font = font;
        Color = color;
    }

    public override BusinessCardPrototype Clone()
    {
        return (BusinessCardPrototype)MemberwiseClone();
    }
}

public class BusinessCardDesigner
{
    BusinessCardPrototype _businessCard;

    public BusinessCardDesigner(BusinessCardPrototype businessCard)
    {
        _businessCard = businessCard;
    }

    public void ChangeDesign(string design)
    {
        _businessCard = _businessCard.Clone();
        _businessCard.Design = design;
    }

    public void ChangeText(string text)
    {
        _businessCard = _businessCard.Clone();
        _businessCard.Text = text;
    }

    public void ChangeFont(string font)
    {
        _businessCard = _businessCard.Clone();
        _businessCard.Font = font;
    }

    public void ChangeColor(string color)
    {
        _businessCard = _businessCard.Clone();
        _businessCard.Color = color;
    }

    public void PrintBusinessCard()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Printing business card:");
        Console.WriteLine($"Design: {_businessCard.Design}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Text: {_businessCard.Text}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Font: {_businessCard.Font}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Color: {_businessCard.Color}");
    }
}

public class Client
{
    static void Main()
    {
        BusinessCardPrototype businessCard = new BusinessCard("Default design", "Default text", "Arial", "Black");
        BusinessCardDesigner designer = new BusinessCardDesigner(businessCard);

        designer.PrintBusinessCard();

        designer.ChangeDesign("Custom design");
        designer.ChangeText("Custom text");
        designer.ChangeFont("Times New Roman");
        designer.ChangeColor("Blue");

        designer.PrintBusinessCard();
    }
}
```
