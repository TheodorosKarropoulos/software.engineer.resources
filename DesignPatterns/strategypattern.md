#### Strategy Design Pattern
Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms or behaviors, encapsulate each one as a separate class, and make them interchangeable at runtime. The pattern enables you to select the algorithm or behavior dynamically based on the specific context or requirements.
*Pros:*
- Encapsulation: The strategy pattern encapsulates each algorithm or behavior into separate classes, promoting better code organization and maintainability. Each strategy class focuses on a specific task, making the code easier to understand and modify.
- Flexibility and Dynamic Behavior: The pattern allows you to switch between different strategies at runtime. You can select the appropriate strategy based on the specific context or requirements. This flexibility enables you to adapt and extend the system without modifying the core code.
- Code Reusability: Strategies can be reused in different parts of the application or in other projects. Since each strategy is encapsulated in its own class, it can be used independently without duplicating code or violating the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Testability: The strategy pattern promotes easier testing because each strategy can be tested independently. You can create separate test cases for each strategy class, ensuring that they function correctly. This modular approach simplifies unit testing and makes it more manageable.

*Cons:*
- Increased Complexity: Introducing multiple strategy classes and the need for selecting and managing strategies can increase the complexity of the codebase. This complexity can make the code harder to understand, especially for simple scenarios where the strategy pattern might be an overkill.
- Overhead of Indirection: The strategy pattern introduces an additional layer of indirection. Instead of directly invoking a specific algorithm, you have to go through the abstraction layer of the strategy interface. This indirection can slightly impact performance, although the actual impact is often negligible.
- Potential for Object Proliferation: If there are a large number of strategies, each implemented as a separate class, it can lead to a proliferation of objects. This can increase memory consumption and add a slight overhead in terms of object creation and management.
- Coupling Strategy and Context: The strategy pattern requires the client code (context) to have knowledge of the available strategies and be responsible for selecting the appropriate strategy. This can introduce a level of coupling between the context and the strategies, making the code less flexible if new strategies need to be added.

*When to use the strategy pattern:*
- Multiple Algorithms or Behaviors: When you have multiple algorithms or behaviors that can be used interchangeably, and you want to encapsulate them separately. The strategy pattern allows you to define each algorithm or behavior as a separate strategy, making it easy to switch between them based on the specific context.
- Runtime Selection of Strategy: When you need to dynamically select and switch between different strategies at runtime based on varying requirements or conditions. The strategy pattern enables you to make the selection and configuration of strategies flexible and adaptable.
- Avoiding Conditional Statements: When you want to avoid using conditional statements (such as if-else or switch-case) that would otherwise determine the behavior of an object. Instead, you can delegate the responsibility to the strategy objects, making the code more maintainable and extensible.
- Promoting Code Reusability: When you have common functionality or algorithms that can be reused across different parts of the application or in other projects. By encapsulating each strategy in a separate class, you can promote code reuse and prevent duplication.
- Testing and Maintainability: When you want to improve the testability and maintainability of your code. By separating the algorithms or behaviors into independent strategy classes, you can easily test and modify them without affecting the rest of the codebase.
- Supporting Open/Closed Principle: When you want to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle, which states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. The strategy pattern allows you to add new strategies without modifying existing code, promoting extensibility.

*Use Case:*
Let's consider a use case where we have a shopping application that calculates discounts for different types of products. We can use the strategy pattern to implement different discount strategies based on the product category
*Implementation:*
```csharp
using System;

// Strategy interface
public interface IDiscountStrategy
{
    double CalculateDiscount(double price);
}

// Concrete strategy classes

public class ElectronicsDiscountStrategy : IDiscountStrategy
{
    public double CalculateDiscount(double price)
    {
        // Apply a 10% discount for electronics
        return price * 0.9;
    }
}

public class ClothingDiscountStrategy : IDiscountStrategy
{
    public double CalculateDiscount(double price)
    {
        // Apply a 20% discount for clothing
        return price * 0.8;
    }
}

public class BookDiscountStrategy : IDiscountStrategy
{
    public double CalculateDiscount(double price)
    {
        // Apply a 5% discount for books
        return price * 0.95;
    }
}

// Context class
public class Product
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Price { get; set; }
    public IDiscountStrategy DiscountStrategy { get; set; }

    public double CalculateDiscountedPrice()
    {
        // Delegate the discount calculation to the selected strategy
        return DiscountStrategy.CalculateDiscount(Price);
    }
}

// Usage example
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Create products with different discount strategies
        var electronics = new Product
        {
            Name = "Smartphone",
            Price = 1000,
            DiscountStrategy = new ElectronicsDiscountStrategy()
        };

        var clothing = new Product
        {
            Name = "T-Shirt",
            Price = 50,
            DiscountStrategy = new ClothingDiscountStrategy()
        };

        var book = new Product
        {
            Name = "Novel",
            Price = 20,
            DiscountStrategy = new BookDiscountStrategy()
        };

        // Calculate discounted prices
        Console.WriteLine($"Discounted price of {electronics.Name}: {electronics.CalculateDiscountedPrice()}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Discounted price of {clothing.Name}: {clothing.CalculateDiscountedPrice()}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Discounted price of {book.Name}: {book.CalculateDiscountedPrice()}");
    }
}
```
