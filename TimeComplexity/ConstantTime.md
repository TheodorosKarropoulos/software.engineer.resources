### Example of an algorithm with time complexity O(1) in C#

This algorithm simply returns the first element of an array, which can be done in constant time (O(1)). The time complexity of the algorithm does not depend on the size of the array, so it is O(1).

```csharp
public int GetFirstElement(int[] array)
{
    return array[0];
}
```
