## Anti-patterns

- [Spaghetti code](spaghetti-code.md): Code that is poorly structured, difficult to read, and hard to maintain.
- [Golden hammer](golden-hammer.md): Using a particular solution or tool for every problem, even when it may not be the best fit.
- [Copy-paste programming](copy-paste-programming.md): Copying and pasting code without understanding how it works or modifying it to fit the specific context.
- [God object](god-object.md): A class that has too many responsibilities and becomes difficult to maintain.
- [Leaky abstractions](leaky-abstraction.md): Abstractions that break down or "leak" implementation details, making the code harder to understand and maintain.
- [Accidental complexity](accidental-complexity.md): Adding unnecessary complexity to the codebase, making it harder to understand and maintain.
- Premature optimization: Optimizing code without a clear understanding of the performance trade-offs and their impact on the overall system.
- Not invented here: Refusing to use external libraries or solutions, even when they would be more appropriate, because of a preference for in-house solutions.
