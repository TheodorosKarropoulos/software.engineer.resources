## Leaky Abstraction
The `Leaky Abstraction` anti-pattern occurs when the underlying complexities of a system or library "leak" through the abstraction layer meant to simplify it. In other words, developers using an abstraction are forced to deal with details that the abstraction was supposed to shield them from, diminishing the usefulness of the abstraction.
#### Simple Explanation:
Imagine you're using a tool that's supposed to make things easy for you, but unexpectedly, you find yourself dealing with the inner workings and complexities of that tool. This is a leaky abstraction.
#### Example of Leaky Abstraction (Before):
Consider a simplified scenario where you have an abstraction for a file storage system, but it leaks details about the underlying storage implementation:
```csharp
public interface IFileStorage
{
    void SaveFile(string fileName, byte[] content);
    byte[] ReadFile(string fileName);
}

public class LocalFileStorage : IFileStorage
{
    public void SaveFile(string fileName, byte[] content)
    {
        // Save the file to the local file system
        // Implementation details leaking through the abstraction
    }

    public byte[] ReadFile(string fileName)
    {
        // Read the file from the local file system
        // More implementation details exposed
    }
}
```
In this example, the abstraction (IFileStorage) is intended to provide a simple interface for saving and reading files, but it leaks details about the fact that the files are stored locally.

#### Refactored Code (After):
To fix the leaky abstraction, you can make the underlying storage details more abstract:
```csharp
public interface IFileStorage
{
    void SaveFile(string fileName, byte[] content);
    byte[] ReadFile(string fileName);
}

public class LocalFileStorage : IFileStorage
{
    private LocalFileSystem localFileSystem;

    public LocalFileStorage(LocalFileSystem localFileSystem)
    {
        this.localFileSystem = localFileSystem;
    }

    public void SaveFile(string fileName, byte[] content)
    {
        localFileSystem.SaveFileLocally(fileName, content);
    }

    public byte[] ReadFile(string fileName)
    {
        return localFileSystem.ReadFileLocally(fileName);
    }
}

public class LocalFileSystem
{
    public void SaveFileLocally(string fileName, byte[] content)
    {
        // Save the file to the local file system
    }

    public byte[] ReadFileLocally(string fileName)
    {
        // Read the file from the local file system
        return null;
    }
}
```
In the refactored code, the `LocalFileSystem` class is introduced to encapsulate the details of saving and reading files locally. The `LocalFileStorage` class now delegates the actual file storage operations to an instance of `LocalFileSystem`, making the abstraction cleaner and hiding the implementation details of the local file system. This helps prevent the leaky abstraction by providing a clearer separation between the abstraction and its implementation.
