## Copy-paste programming
The `Copy-paste programming` anti-pattern is a practice where a developer copies existing code and pastes it elsewhere in the codebase, often with little to no modification. This approach may seem quick and convenient, but it can lead to various problems and is generally considered a bad practice in software development.
#### Copy-paste programming could lead to the following errors and challenges:
1. Code Duplication
    - Copy-pasting code results in having similar or identical code in multiple places within your project. This duplication makes the codebase larger and harder to maintain.
2. Maintenance Challenges
    - When a bug is found or a feature needs to be added, developers must make changes in every location where the code was copied. This can lead to oversights, inconsistencies, and increased maintenance effort.
3. Risk of Errors
    - Copy-pasting increases the likelihood of introducing errors. If you fix a bug in one location but forget to update the copied code elsewhere, inconsistencies may arise.
4. Reduced Readability
    - Code that is repeated in multiple places can make the overall structure of the program more difficult to understand. It becomes harder to grasp the logic and intent of the code.
5. Missed Opportunities for Abstraction
    - Copy-paste programming often overlooks opportunities for creating reusable functions or abstractions. Abstracting common functionality into separate functions or classes can lead to cleaner, more maintainable code.

In essence, while copying and pasting code might provide a quick solution in the short term, it often results in long-term challenges that hinder the maintainability, readability, and reliability of the codebase. It's generally advisable to refactor duplicated code into reusable components, functions, or classes to promote a more efficient and maintainable codebase.
