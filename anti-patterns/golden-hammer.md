## Golden hammer
The `Golden Hammer` anti-pattern, also known as the `Law of the Instrument`, occurs when a developer relies too heavily on a familiar tool or technology, even when it may not be the best fit for the task at hand. This can lead to suboptimal solutions and missed opportunities to use more appropriate tools or approaches.
### Golden Hammer Example (C#):
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the area calculator!");
        Console.Write("Enter the radius: ");
        double radius = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

        double area = CalculateAreaWithGoldenHammer(radius);
        Console.WriteLine("The area is: " + area);
    }

    static double CalculateAreaWithGoldenHammer(double radius)
    {
        // Using a simple approximation for pi
        double pi = 3.14;
        return pi * Math.Pow(radius, 2);
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Golden Hammer` is the use of a hardcoded approximation for pi (3.14) instead of a more accurate approach. The developer is relying on a familiar tool (a hardcoded value) rather than exploring better alternatives, such as using Math.PI for a more accurate representation of pi.
### Refactored Code:
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the area calculator!");
        Console.Write("Enter the radius: ");
        double radius = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

        double area = CalculateArea(radius);
        Console.WriteLine("The area is: " + area);
    }

    static double CalculateArea(double radius)
    {
        return Math.PI * Math.Pow(radius, 2);
    }
}
```
In the refactored code, the `Golden Hammer` has been addressed by using `Math.PI` instead of the hardcoded approximation. This change makes the code more accurate and eliminates the reliance on an inappropriate tool for representing the mathematical constant pi.
### Takeaway
The key takeaway is to be mindful of using the right tools and approaches for the task at hand, rather than relying on familiar solutions that may not be the best fit.
