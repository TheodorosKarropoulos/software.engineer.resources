## Dealing with Generalization
Generalization refers to the practice of making code more abstract or reusable by removing specifics that limit its flexibility. This often involves replacing specific implementations with more general, flexible abstractions, such as interfaces, base classes, or generic types. The goal is to increase the adaptability of your code, allowing it to handle a wider range of scenarios without requiring major changes.
### Why Use Generalization?
- Reusability: Reduces code duplication by abstracting common functionality.
- Flexibility: Makes your code more adaptable to future changes.
- Maintainability: Easier to modify or extend without affecting other parts of the system.
- Testability: Makes it easier to mock or replace implementations during unit testing.
