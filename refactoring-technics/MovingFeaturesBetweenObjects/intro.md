## Moving Features Between Objects in Refactoring
Moving features between objects is a common refactoring technique used to redistribute responsibility between objects in a system. This can help improve cohesion, reduce coupling, and make the code more maintainable and understandable. It involves transferring methods or fields from one class to another, typically when the feature logically belongs more to the other class.

The main goal of moving features between objects is to improve the overall design by ensuring that classes have a well-defined responsibility and that responsibilities are appropriately distributed.
### Why Use This Technique?
- Improved Cohesion: Ensures that related behavior is grouped together in the appropriate class.
- Reduced Coupling: Moves functionality closer to the data it operates on, reducing dependencies between objects.
- Easier Maintenance: By grouping related methods and fields in the right objects, it becomes easier to maintain and extend the code.
- Better Readability: The classâ€™s responsibility becomes clearer.
### Techniques
- [Extract class](extract-class.md): Move a group of related methods and variables into a separate class.
- [Move Method](): Relocate a method to a class where it is more relevant or frequently used
- [Move Field](): Move a field to the class that uses it most
- [Inline Class](): Merge a class into another if it no longer serves a meaningful purpose
