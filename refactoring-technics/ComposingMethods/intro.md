## Composing Methods
This group of techniques is especially focused on improving the structure of methods by breaking them down into smaller, more focused pieces or consolidating redundant code.
- [Extract method](extract-method.md): Move a block of code into a separate method with a descriptive name.
- [Extract variable](extract-variable.md): Replace an expression with a descriptive variable name.
- [Inline Method](): Replace a method call with the method's content if it's trivial or unnecessary
- [Replace Temp with Query](): Replace temporary variables with methods that directly calculate the required value
- [Introduce Parameter Object](): Consolidate multiple method parameters into a single object
