## Breaking Dependencies
Breaking dependencies is a key practice in software development that focuses on decoupling tightly coupled components or modules in a system. This increases the flexibility of the code, making it easier to maintain, extend, and test. It also enables better separation of concerns, allowing each component to be responsible for its own domain, rather than tightly depending on others.

By breaking dependencies, you make it easier to swap implementations, replace modules, and mock components for testing.
### Goals of Breaking Dependencies
- Improve Testability: Allow components to be tested in isolation by removing hard dependencies.
- Increase Flexibility: Make it easier to change or replace dependencies without impacting other parts of the system.
- Enhance Maintainability: Simplify code changes and future enhancements.
- Encourage Separation of Concerns: Ensure each component has a clear, single responsibility.
