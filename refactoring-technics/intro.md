## Refactoring
### What is Refactoring?
Refactoring is the process of improving the internal structure of existing code without changing its external behavior. It is a disciplined technique for restructuring code to make it cleaner, more efficient, and easier to understand while maintaining the same functionality.

Refactoring is an essential practice in software development, enabling developers to make their code more maintainable and adaptable to future changes without introducing bugs.
