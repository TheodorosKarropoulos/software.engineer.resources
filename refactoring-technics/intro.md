## Refactoring Technics

- Extract method: Move a block of code into a separate method with a descriptive name.
- Extract variable: Replace an expression with a descriptive variable name.
- Rename: Rename a class, method, or variable to make its purpose clearer.
- Inline: Replace a method call with the contents of the method.
- Replace conditional with polymorphism: Replace a conditional statement with polymorphism (using inheritance or interface implementation) to make the code more flexible and maintainable.
- Replace loop with pipeline: Replace a loop with a pipeline of functions to make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
- Extract class: Move a group of related methods and variables into a separate class.
- Replace inheritance with delegation: Replace inheritance with delegation (using composition) to improve the flexibility and maintainability of the code.
- Replace magic numbers with constants: Replace "magic numbers" (hard-coded values) with named constants to make the code more readable and maintainable.
- Consolidate duplicated code: Remove duplicated code by extracting common functionality into a separate method.
