#### Introduction
Software engineering and architecture are key disciplines in the field of computer science, concerned with the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. In this repository, you will find a variety of resources on these topics, ranging from general best practices to specific design patterns and real-world case studies.

#### Time Complexity
[Time complexity](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/TimeComplexity/TimeComplexityIntro.md) is a measure of how long an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input.

#### Best Practices
- [Clean Code](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/BestPractices/CleanCode.md): A classic book on writing clean, maintainable code.
- [SOLID Principles](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/tree/main/BestPractices/SOLID): A set of five principles for designing object-oriented software.
- [DRY](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/BestPractices/DRY.md): It is a way of designing software systems so that every piece of knowledge is expressed in a single, unambiguous way.
- [KISS](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/BestPractices/KISS.md): It is a way of designing software systems with a focus on simplicity and minimalism.
- [YAGNI](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/BestPractices/YAGNI.md): It is a software development principle that advises developers to avoid adding unnecessary features or functionality to a software system.
- [Agile Development](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/BestPractices/AgileDevelopment.md): A software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid iteration.

#### Design Patterns
[Design Patterns](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/DesignPatterns/Introduction.md) are established solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They provide a way for developers to reuse successful designs and avoid reinventing the wheel

#### Anti-patterns

- Spaghetti code: Code that is poorly structured, difficult to read, and hard to maintain.
- Golden hammer: Using a particular solution or tool for every problem, even when it may not be the best fit.
- Copy-paste programming: Copying and pasting code without understanding how it works or modifying it to fit the specific context.
- God object: A class that has too many responsibilities and becomes difficult to maintain.
- Leaky abstractions: Abstractions that break down or "leak" implementation details, making the code harder to understand and maintain.
- Accidental complexity: Adding unnecessary complexity to the codebase, making it harder to understand and maintain.
- Premature optimization: Optimizing code without a clear understanding of the performance trade-offs and their impact on the overall system.
- Not invented here: Refusing to use external libraries or solutions, even when they would be more appropriate, because of a preference for in-house solutions.
