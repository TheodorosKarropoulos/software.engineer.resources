#### DRY Principle

The DRY principle is a software development principle that stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." It is a way of designing software systems so that every piece of knowledge is expressed in a single, unambiguous way.

The DRY principle is based on the idea that if you have to write the same information multiple times, it increases the likelihood of errors and makes the system more difficult to maintain. By expressing knowledge in a single, central place, you can reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of the system.

Here are some ways to apply the DRY principle in software development:

- Avoid duplicating code: Instead of writing the same code in multiple places, try to find a way to reuse it. This could involve creating functions or modules that can be called from multiple places, or using inheritance or mixins to share code between classes.
- Avoid duplicating data: Instead of storing the same data in multiple places, try to store it in a single, central location and access it from there. This could involve using a database or other centralized data storage system.
- Use descriptive names: Choose descriptive names for variables, functions, and other elements of your code to clearly convey their purpose. This will help reduce the need for comments and make your code easier to understand.
- Use automated tests: Automated tests can help ensure that your code is correct and avoid the need to manually test it. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors.

The DRY principle is designed to solve the problem of duplication in software systems. When you have multiple copies of the same information scattered throughout your code, it can lead to a number of problems, including:

- Increased maintenance costs: If you have to update the same information in multiple places, it takes more time and effort to make the changes. This can make it more expensive to maintain the system over time.
- Increased risk of errors: If you have to update the same information in multiple places, there is a higher risk that you will miss one of the updates or make a mistake when making the changes. This can lead to bugs and other issues in the system.
- Decreased understandability: If you have to read through multiple copies of the same information to understand how a system works, it can make it more difficult to understand and work with the code.

By applying the DRY principle, you can avoid these problems by ensuring that every piece of knowledge is expressed in a single, unambiguous way. This can make your code easier to maintain, understand, and work with, which can save time and reduce the risk of errors.

There are several benefits to applying the DRY principle in software development:

- Reduced maintenance costs: By avoiding duplication, you can reduce the amount of time and effort required to maintain the system. This can save time and money in the long run.
- Improved code quality: By avoiding duplication, you can reduce the risk of errors and improve the overall quality of the code. This can make it easier to work with and understand the code.
- Increased understandability: By expressing knowledge in a single, unambiguous way, you can make the code easier to understand and work with. This can make it easier for new team members to learn the codebase and for existing team members to work on new features.
- Increased flexibility: By avoiding duplication, you can make it easier to make changes to the system without affecting other parts of the code. This can make it easier to add new features or modify existing ones.
- Improved collaboration: By making the code easier to understand and work with, you can make it easier for team members to collaborate and work together effectively.

In this example, the `CalculateTotal` and `CalculateDiscountedTotal` methods both perform the same calculation of adding three prices together. This violates the DRY principle because the same calculation is being written in two different places.

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public static int CalculateTotal(int price1, int price2, int price3)
    {
        return price1 + price2 + price3;
    }

    public static int CalculateDiscountedTotal(int price1, int price2, int price3, double discount)
    {
        return (int)((price1 + price2 + price3) * (1 - discount));
    }
}
```

To refactor this code to follow the DRY principle, we can extract the common calculation into a separate function and pass the prices as an array:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public static int CalculateTotal(int[] prices)
    {
        return prices.Sum();
    }

    public static int CalculateDiscountedTotal(int[] prices, double discount)
    {
        return (int)(CalculateTotal(prices) * (1 - discount));
    }
}
```

Now, the `CalculateTotal` method uses the `Sum` extension method from the `System.Linq` namespace to add the prices together, and the `CalculateDiscountedTotal` method calls the `CalculateTotal` method to get the total and applies the discount. This eliminates the duplication of the calculation and makes the code easier to maintain.
