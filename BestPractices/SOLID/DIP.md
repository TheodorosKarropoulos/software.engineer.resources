#### Dependency Inversion Principle

*Definition:*

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a software design principle that states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This means that you should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations, and that you should aim to decouple your code from specific technologies or frameworks.

*Code Example:*

```csharp
public interface IDatabase
{
    void Save(string data);
}

public class SqlDatabase : IDatabase
{
    public void Save(string data)
    {
        // Save data to SQL database
    }
}

public class MongoDatabase : IDatabase
{
    public void Save(string data)
    {
        // Save data to MongoDB database
    }
}

public class DataSaver
{
    private readonly IDatabase database;
    public DataSaver(IDatabase database)
    {
        this.database = database;
    }

    public void SaveData(string data)
    {
        database.Save(data);
    }
}
```

In this example, the IDatabase interface defines a single method, Save(), which can be used to save data to a database. The SqlDatabase and MongoDatabase classes both implement this interface, and they provide specific implementations for saving data to a SQL database or a MongoDB database, respectively. The DataSaver class depends on the IDatabase interface, rather than on any specific implementation. This allows it to work with any class that implements the IDatabase interface, without needing to know or care about the specific details of how the data is saved. This demonstrates the Dependency Inversion Principle, since the DataSaver class is decoupled from the low-level details of how the data is saved, and is instead depending on the abstraction provided by the IDatabase interface.
