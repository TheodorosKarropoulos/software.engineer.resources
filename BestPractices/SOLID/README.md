### SOLID Principles

- [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/BestPractices/SOLID/SRP.md) (SRP) A class should have only one reason to change.
- [Open / Closed Principle](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/BestPractices/SOLID/OCP.md) (OCP) Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/BestPractices/SOLID/LSP.md) (LSP) Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. 
- [Interface Segregation Principle](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/BestPractices/SOLID/ISP.md) (ISP) Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/TheodorosKarropoulos/software.engineer.resources/blob/main/BestPractices/SOLID/DIP.md) (DIP) High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
